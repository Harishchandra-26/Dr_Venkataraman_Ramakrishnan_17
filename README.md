🌊 JalRakshak


AI-Powered Waterborne Disease Early Warning System for India

Predict • Prevent • Protect

JalRakshak is an AI-driven public health intelligence platform that predicts waterborne disease outbreaks 7–14 days in advance, enabling proactive interventions for Indian urban and rural communities.

🎯 Problem Statement

India experiences recurring outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and acute diarrhea, primarily due to:

Monsoon-driven water contamination

Inadequate drainage & sanitation

High population density

Delayed, reactive healthcare responses

Current systems act after outbreaks begin — leading to avoidable loss of life and healthcare overload.

💡 Our Solution

JalRakshak transforms public health from reactive to predictive.

Using machine learning + geospatial analytics, the system identifies high-risk zones before an outbreak occurs, allowing governments and NGOs to act early.
