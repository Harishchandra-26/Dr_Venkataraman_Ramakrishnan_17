🌊 JalRakshak
AI-Powered Waterborne Disease Early Warning System for India

Predict • Prevent • Protect

JalRakshak is an AI-driven public-health intelligence platform that predicts waterborne disease outbreaks 7–14 days in advance, enabling proactive intervention across urban and rural India.

🎯 Problem

India faces recurring outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, and acute diarrheal diseases due to:

Monsoon-induced flooding and water contamination

Poor drainage and sanitation infrastructure

High population density, especially in urban slums

Reactive healthcare systems that respond only after outbreaks begin

Current surveillance systems lack early-warning capabilities, resulting in avoidable loss of life and overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure.

💡 Solution

JalRakshak shifts public health from reactive to predictive.

By combining machine learning, geospatial intelligence, and real-time data, the platform identifies high-risk zones before outbreaks occur, allowing authorities to act early and effectively.
