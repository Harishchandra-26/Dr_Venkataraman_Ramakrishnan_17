JalRakshak: AI-Powered Waterborne Disease Outbreak Prediction System
🎯 Project Overview
An AI-driven early warning system that predicts waterborne disease outbreaks in Indian urban and rural communities 7-14 days in advance, enabling proactive public health interventions.

🏥 The Problem
India faces significant challenges with waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, especially during monsoon seasons. Current approaches are reactive - responding after outbreaks occur - leading to preventable loss of life and strained healthcare resources.

💡 Our Solution
JalRakshak transforms public health response from reactive to proactive by analyzing multiple risk factors using machine learning to predict outbreaks before they happen.

Key Features
🔍 Predictive Analytics: ML models analyze 7 critical risk factors

🗺️ Interactive Dashboard: Real-time risk heatmaps and visualization

⚠️ Early Warning Alerts: 7-14 day advance notifications

🎯 Actionable Insights: Specific recommendations for each high-risk zone

📱 Mobile Integration: Field worker app for ground reporting

📊 7 Risk Factors Analyzed
Rainfall Patterns - Monsoon intensity and waterlogging

Drainage Infrastructure - Sewage and stormwater management quality

Population Density - Vulnerability in crowded areas

Water Contamination - Source water quality monitoring

Sanitation Coverage - Toilet access and waste management

Climate Conditions - Temperature and humidity correlations

Historical Outbreak Data - Past disease patterns and trends

🛠️ Technology Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI, TensorFlow/PyTorch

Frontend: React.js, Mapbox/Leaflet

Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (geospatial)

Cloud: AWS/Azure/GCP (scalable deployment)

Mobile: Flutter (cross-platform)

🚀 Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Pilot Development (6 months)
ML model development with synthetic data

Dashboard prototype for 2-3 cities

Validation with health officials

Phase 2: Scale-Up (12 months)
